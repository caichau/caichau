# Caitlyn Chau 

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

I have a solid background in C, C++, and Python, and a growing passion for building intelligent, impactful solutions. I'm currently exploring mobile app development with React Native and Typescript, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. 

I’m particularly interested in the intersections of technology and environment, supporting sustainability, and contributing to solutions to environmental issues.

## Technical Skills: 
- Languages: C, C++, Python
- Machine Learning: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn
- Currently Learning 🌱: TypeScript and React Native for mobile app development, CSS
- Development Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

## Projects: 
| Project      | Description | Tech |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Input/Output Classification in an SRH Chatbot | Analyzed data and multiple supervised machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GBDT, SVC), with the goal to evaluate the performance of PPFA’s sexual and reproductive health chatbot. | Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK |
| Classifying Fire-Prone Areas, Group Project  | Conducted exploratory data analysis in Python using Pandas and Seaborn, gaining an effective understanding of the underlying patterns and correlations. Trained SVM, ANN, and Logistic Regression machine learning models, accurately predicting fire-prone areas within a forested wilderness area.  |  Python, scikit-learn, Pandas |
| Chess Game, Group Project | Communicated and collaborated with group to break down the problem, applying modularity and object-oriented programming concepts to code the logic of a chess game with Python. Created unit tests with PyTest to debug and test the code. |   Python | 
| Honeybee Object Detection and Counting, Group Project | Collaborated with a group to train object detection models using the PyTorch framework, resulting in accurate detection and counting of honeybees in the image dataset. Wrote Python code to calculate metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and average precision, resulting in graphs and data to evaluate the performance of each model. | Python, PyTorch |
